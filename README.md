This is a new React Three JS project, bootstrapped using @react-three/drei @react-three/fiber @react-framer-motion & @valtio.

Getting Started
Note: Make sure you have completed the React - Environment Setup instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

Step 1: Start the client Dev Server

To start Dev Server, run the following command from the root/client of your React Three Js project:

# using npm

npm run dev

# OR using Yarn

yarn run dev

Step 2: Start your Application

Let Dev Server run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React project. Run the following command to start your backend Server Side Dev:

For Android

# using npm

npm yarn start

# OR using Yarn

yarn start

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app running in your Browser client And Node Js Server have been set up on backendend side correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
